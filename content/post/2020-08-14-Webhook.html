<div id="what-is-a-webhook" class="section level1">
<h1>What is a webhook?</h1>
<p>Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by some event, such as pushing code to a repository or a comment being posted to a blog. When that event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook. In my case, I wanted to enable a callback when a file was uploaded to a Box folder owned by my organization.</p>

<li><p>In order for app to access folders set up by my organization and to act as a webhook, I needed to set some additional configurations:</p></li>

<h1>Associate app owner login ID with webhook folder</h1>
<p>I needed to ask an account administrator to look up my app’s owner login ID. It looks like an email address: <a href="mailto:AutomationUser_blah@boxdevedition.com" class="email">AutomationUser_blah@boxdevedition.com</a></p>
<p>Then navigate to the folder associated with webhook and share this folder with the app owner login ID:</p>

<h1>Set up Google Sheets to listen to webhook notifications</h1>
<p>Following the helpful guide in the <a href="https://blog.runscope.com/posts/tutorial-capturing-webhooks-with-google-sheets">Runscope Blog</a>, I was able to use a <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheet</a> as a web app to listen to webhook notifications. Once I set up the app and obtained the Google Sheet URL, I was ready to create the webhook.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-webhook-for-folder" class="section level1">
<h1>Create webhook for folder</h1>
<p>I used this <a href="https://developer.box.com/guides/webhooks/manage/for-folder/#webhook-triggers">Box guide</a> as a starting point to set up the webhook for folder using Python.</p>
<p>You will need the following information to set up webhook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Box folder ID: Navigate to folder in Box. The folder ID will be string of numbers at end of URL: (i.e. <a href="https://cadwr.app.box.com/folder/123456789101" class="uri">https://cadwr.app.box.com/folder/123456789101</a>, folder_id = 123456789101)</li>
<li>Google Sheets app URL (i.e. <a href="https://script.google.com/macros/s/UNIQUE_KEY/exec" class="uri">https://script.google.com/macros/s/UNIQUE_KEY/exec</a>)</li>
<li>JSON configuration file name (i.e. blah_blah_config.json)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the Python code for setting up a webhook to be notified when a file is uploaded to a folder:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from boxsdk import JWTAuth

#Path to JWT config
auth = JWTAuth.from_settings_file(&#39;blah_blah_config.json&#39;)

from boxsdk import Client

client = Client(auth)

# set up webhook on root folder and will work with all subfolders
rootfolder = client.folder(folder_id=&#39;123456789101&#39;)

#Set up webhook listener for Google Sheets app
webhook = client.create_webhook(rootfolder, [&#39;FILE.UPLOADED&#39;], &#39;https://script.google.com/macros/s/UNIQUE_KEY/exec&#39;)
print(&#39;Webhook ID is {0} and the address is {1}&#39;.format(webhook.id, webhook.address))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="receiving-a-webhook-notification-in-google-sheets-and-parsing-json-using-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Receiving a webhook notification in Google Sheets and parsing JSON using R</h1>
<p>Now that webhook has been set up, it is time to see what the notification looks like in Google Sheets. After uploading a blank PDF to any subfolder of my root folder (folder set up for webhook), this is the notification:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/webhook_response.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Webhook notification in Google Sheets</p>
</div>
<p>In order to parse the JSON text in notification, I used R. For my project, I needed the file name and URL, but the script could be adapted for information of interest from JSON notification:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(data.table) # rbindlist
library(tidyverse)
library(gsheet)
library(jsonlite)

url &lt;-
  &#39;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/UNIQUE_ID/edit?usp=sharing&#39;

file &lt;-
  read.csv(text = gsheet2text(url, format = &#39;csv&#39;),
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# rename columns from Google Sheet to meaningful headers
file &lt;-
  file %&gt;% select(X, X.5) %&gt;% rename(Date = X, Information = X.5)

# convert JSON information to R object
json_data &lt;- lapply(file$Information, fromJSON)

# extract source because information you need is in there
source &lt;- lapply(json_data, `[[`, c(&#39;source&#39;))

# extract URL and file name
id_name &lt;- lapply(source, `[`, c(&#39;id&#39;, &#39;name&#39;))

# bind rows into one dataframe for multiple notifications
data &lt;- rbindlist(id_name, use.names = TRUE, fill = TRUE)

# paste id to end of full URL
data$id &lt;- paste0(&quot;https://cadwr.app.box.com/file/&quot;, data$id)
</code></pre>
</div>
