# What is a webhook?

Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by some event, such as pushing code to a repository or a comment being posted to a blog. When that event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook. In my case, I wanted to enable a callback when a file was uploaded to a Box folder owned by my organization. 

# Initial webhook app configuration in Box Developer
1) I followed the [Setup with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) guide](https://developer.box.com/guides/applications/custom-apps/jwt-setup/) from Box to set up app. 

2) In order for app to access folders set up by my organization and to act as a webhook, I needed to set some additional configurations:

3) I saved the downloaded JSON configuration file with keypairs in a known location.

# Associate app owner login ID with webhook folder

I needed to ask an account administrator to look up my app's owner login ID. It looks like an email address: AutomationUser_blah@boxdevedition.com

Then navigate to the folder associated with webhook and share this folder with the app owner login ID:

# Set up Google Sheets to listen to webhook notifications
Following the helpful guide in the [Runscope Blog](https://blog.runscope.com/posts/tutorial-capturing-webhooks-with-google-sheets), I was able to use a [Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) as a web app to listen to webhook notifications. Once I set up the app and obtained the Google Sheet URL, I was ready to create the webhook.

# Create webhook for folder
I used this [Box guide](https://developer.box.com/guides/webhooks/manage/for-folder/#webhook-triggers) as a starting point to set up the webhook for folder using Python. 

You will need the following information to set up webhook:

- Box folder ID: Navigate to folder in Box. The folder ID will be string of numbers at end of URL: (i.e. https://cadwr.app.box.com/folder/123456789101, folder_id = 123456789101)
- Google Sheets app URL (i.e. https://script.google.com/macros/s/UNIQUE_KEY/exec)
- JSON configuration file name (i.e. blah_blah_config.json)

Here is the Python code for setting up a webhook to be notified when a file is uploaded to a folder:

```{python eval=FALSE}
from boxsdk import JWTAuth

#Path to JWT config
auth = JWTAuth.from_settings_file('blah_blah_config.json')

from boxsdk import Client

client = Client(auth)

# set up webhook on root folder and will work with all subfolders
rootfolder = client.folder(folder_id='123456789101')

#Set up webhook listener for Google Sheets app
webhook = client.create_webhook(rootfolder, ['FILE.UPLOADED'], 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/UNIQUE_KEY/exec')
print('Webhook ID is {0} and the address is {1}'.format(webhook.id, webhook.address))
````

# Receiving a webhook notification in Google Sheets and parsing JSON using R
Now that webhook has been set up, it is time to see what the notification looks like in Google Sheets. After uploading a blank PDF to any subfolder of my root folder (folder set up for webhook), this is the notification:

![Webhook notification in Google Sheets](/img/webhook_response.png)

In order to parse the JSON text in notification, I used R. For my project, I needed the file name and URL, but the script could be adapted for information of interest from JSON notification:

````{r eval=FALSE}
library(data.table) # rbindlist
library(tidyverse)
library(gsheet)
library(jsonlite)

url <-
  'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/UNIQUE_ID/edit?usp=sharing'

file <-
  read.csv(text = gsheet2text(url, format = 'csv'),
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# rename columns from Google Sheet to meaningful headers
file <-
  file %>% select(X, X.5) %>% rename(Date = X, Information = X.5)

# convert JSON information to R object
json_data <- lapply(file$Information, fromJSON)

# extract source because information you need is in there
source <- lapply(json_data, `[[`, c('source'))

# extract URL and file name
id_name <- lapply(source, `[`, c('id', 'name'))

# bind rows into one dataframe for multiple notifications
data <- rbindlist(id_name, use.names = TRUE, fill = TRUE)

# paste id to end of full URL
data$id <- paste0("https://cadwr.app.box.com/file/", data$id)

````
